# Lane Line Detection

This project was a great project to learn Python, and
used open-cv to detect and draw lane lines on a road.
Here is a output video from it.

## It works in 6 Steps

### Step 1:

Greyscale the image with open-cv

```
cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```

Output Image:

<Image src="/images/greyscale.jpg" width={1914} height={1061} />

### Step 2:

Step two is to blur the image using the [Gaussian Blur algorithm]("https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html?highlight=gaussianblur#gaussianblur")
We do this to prevent unnecessary noise from showing up when we
detect the lane lines.

```
cv2.blur(greyscaled-image, (5,5))
```

The (5,5) repersents the blurring kernel size, or the
ammount to blur the image, with a higher value making
the image more blurry.

Output Image:

<Image src="/images/blurred.jpg" width={1914} height={1061} />

### Step 3:

Detect the edges in the image using the [Canny Edge Detection algorithm.]("https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html")
This works by looking at the differences in color
between pixels to determine if there was a edge. If we
didn't blur the image in the previous step, there would
be too many edges, and it would add lots of noise to the
output.

```
cv2.Canny(image,50,150)
```

Output Image:

<Image src={"/images/edges.jpg"} width={1914} height={1061} />

We're a lot closer to having the final lane lines, but still have a bit to go!

### Step 4:

Select the areas of interest (lane lines) out of the
image using opencv. Step one is to make a blank image
(or a mask) of the image. Next we create a polygon shape
covering where the lane lines will be positioned looking
from a dashcam. After that we put that polygon onto our
mask, creating a filter to sort out our lane lines.
Finally we can combine our mask and our original image
to filter out only the lane lines.

```
#make the polygon to mask the lane lines
rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
bottom_left = [cols * 0.1, rows * 0.95]
top_left = [cols * 0.4, rows * 0.6]
bottom_right = [cols * 0.9, rows * 0.95]
top_right = [cols * 0.6, rows * 0.6]
#create a numpy array of the polygon
vertices = np.array([[bottom_left, top_left,
top_right, bottom_right]], dtype=np.int32)
#create a mask/filter of the polygon's shape
cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices)
#apply the mask to the image
masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, mask)
```

Output Image:

<Image src="/images/mask.jpg" width={1914} height={1061} />

Now we're left with just the lane lines.

### Step 5:

Detect the lines within our masked image. To do this, we
use the hough transform fourmula. What this does is
returns the lines it finds within a image. The downside
to using this strategy is that it can only detect
straight lines within a image, so I might switch to a
different approach in the future.

```
cv2.HoughLinesP(image)
```

There isn't a output image for this because it generates
a mathamatical repersentation of the lane lines rather
than a image.

### Step 6:

We're almost done! We need to draw the lines on the
original image. To do this we iterate through the list
of lines from the last step and use the cv2.line() function to draw the lines on the original image.

```
for line in lines:
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in line:
        cv2.line(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), color, thickness)
```

Output Image:

<Image src="/images/Final.jpg" width={1914} height={1061} />
